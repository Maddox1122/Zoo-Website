                The San Diego Zoo and Safari Park follow the guidance set forth by the State of California and County of San Diego. Notwithstanding our efforts, an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present; we cannot guarantee you will not be exposed during your visit. COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. According to the CDC, older adults and guests of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions are especially vulnerable. Guests should evaluate their risk in determining whether to visit.

While we work hard to provide an exceptional guest experience, occasionally habitats, tours, restaurants, transportation, entertainment, or services change or close without notice and without liability due to refurbishing, capacity, weather or special events.  A daily listing of changes or closures can be found at the main entrance of both parks.  Please check upon arrival.

                  The parking lot in front of the San Diego Zoo does not have designated RV or bus parking spaces. It is a municipal parking lot with accompanying enforcement by the San Diego Police Department. We recommend guests with RVs park along Park Boulevard in front of the Zoo or at the Inspiration Point parking lot (on the east side of Park Boulevard, between Presidents Way and the Balboa Park Activity Center) for easy access to the Zoo and the heart of Balboa Park via the free tram. The parking lot on the south side of Inspiration Point has designated full-size/striped RV and bus parking spaces. The parking lots around Balboa Park are free to the public, per city guidelines.<br>
The Safari Park's parking lot is open and available for RV/bus parking during normal business hours. It has spaces dedicated for large vehicles and parking staff will direct you to the appropriate location to park your oversized vehicle. Please click <a href="#">here</a> for current Safari Park parking fees. The Safari Park does not permit overnight parking except for our Roar and Snore sleepover guests.
