        <p>CHILDREN AND PRIVACY</p>
        <p>San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance is concerned about protecting children’s privacy. If You are under the age of 13, We do not want your personal information. Please do not submit any personal information to Us. We encourage parents to actively protect their children’s privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information to any individual or organization without parental permission. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 years of age has provided us with such information without consent, we will take appropriate action to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that a child under 13 years of age has provided such information to us, he or she should contact us at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, Attention: Donor Privacy Policy, P.O. Box 120271, San Diego, CA 92112. There may be some areas within Our Websites where people may post messages or provide feedback, but those under the age of 13 children are again discouraged from providing any personal information. If a visitor known to be a child (younger than 13) sends an e-mail to San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, We will only use it to respond to the e-mail and not to create profiles or otherwise retain the information.</p>
        <p>SECURE SHOPPING</p>
        <p>San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has incorporated the latest Internet technological standards into the design of the secure purchase areas of its Websites. We also monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to access, upload, or change information on the Websites and across Our network. Under no uncertain terms, any information You send us while within the secure shipping area is protected by 128-bit “Secure Socket Layer” SSL encryption, making Your transaction safe and reliable. You can tell whether you are in our secure shopping area by viewing the “lock” or “key” at the bottom of your browser—an unlocked or broken key (depending on your browser) means you are in an unsecured area.</p>
        <p>Shopping on the Internet is safe, and online credit card transactions are no more risky than other means of shopping. Our encryption methods make credit card fraud even more difficult than mail or phone orders, or even in-person purchases. If You experience fraudulent use of your credit card as a result of using Our Websites, notify your credit card company per its rules and procedures. Most credit card companies will either cover the fraudulent purchases or hold you liable for no more than $50.</p>
        <p>As a standard Internet practice, should your credit card company hold you liable for some portion of a fraudulent charge stemming from Our Website(s), We will reimburse You for the maximum liability of $50, provided the purchase was made through Our secure server.</p>
        <p>San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance requires the use of Your name, e-mail address, shipping address, and credit card number/expiration date in order to process and fulfill Your order. We might also request additional information that you choose to submit about your interests or feedback about our Website(s) and products so that We can provide a better shopping experience for You. The name, address, and payment information that a User might provide when using Our Websites may be processed or disclosed by San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance as permitted under such Website’s Terms of Use, to which the User agrees to upon utilizing the information and services of the Websites.</p>
